Simple calendar with jQuery/Foundation

This is a simple calendar application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. No frameworks. It's not exceptionally functional as you can only set events at single hour intervals, and there is no way to span multiple hours.

Data is stored in localStorage. I used the Foundation CSS framework for layout/styling assistance.

The goal was to create a simple calendar with month navigation on the left, and a day displayed on the right. Clicking on a day in the calendar on the left brings up that day on the right. The page is responsive, so if get to small screen size, the day information drops below the calendar.

There are a couple of helper links on the bottom. One is for generating random events which populate the calendar a couple of months back and forward in time with Star Trek themed events. The other clears all the events so you can get back to a blank calendar.

This is just a mock-up and should not be mistaken for a full-featured app.
